CRYSTAL- Cyber Simulation, Training and Exercise Platform
=======

1. Summary

The fast increasing cyber-criminality is in the focus of todays information age. Espionage and cyber-criminality costs the economy globally a lot of money. Lost of data or intellectual property, cyber-criminalty and other action in cyberspace are also responsible for declining confidence in internet activity as well as increasing pressure on government and armed forces. Therefore it is vital to sensitize multiple user groups to this topic. One medium to do that, is the Cyber Training Platform CRYSTAL. Within this specially for cyber-security built infrastructure, it is possible to acquire skills in the following domains:

* Technical exercise (on a technical level)
* Command and Control exercise (on an operational level)
* Combination of technical and Command & Control exercise

2. Introduction

2.1 Initial situation

Trough new information and communication techniques, vulnerability of political and society processes gets a new dimension. Market is reacting to this change with new product, which deals with threats from cyber-security. Often the education and exercising of his own skills and interactions are trained separately, because no integrated exercise platform is available. The Cyber Training Platform will close this gap with corresponding training infrastructure. On this infrastructure it is possible to train specially designed scenarios. Each scenario has its own participant who shall fulfill special tasks.

2.2 Goal and purpose

CRYSTAL is the environment for users to train, exercice or simulate following goals and purposes:

* Situation awareness
** Dealing with a lot of information on technical side.
** Dealing with the right information for leaders.
** Check, if cyber issues are recognized in time

*Situation handling
** Coordination and information exchange
** Check of internal processes to deal with crisis situation
** Coordination of measures outside the own organisation

* Situation dealing
** Coordination of measures within a team
** check if participants are able to make correct counter-measures
** Increasing of comprehension of consequences of given counter-measures

2.3 Roadmap

The project is divided into 3 phases:

2.3.1 Phase I: Prototype
Step A: Infrastucture
Step B: Technical Layer, working Scenario
Step C: Operational Layer, Integration Event Injection System
Phase II: Automation and Scenario development
Phase III: Integration of distributed CRYSTAL instance
Phase I, Step A: Infrastucture

* Definition and build of infrastucture
* Build a ready to use hardware plattform
* Evaluation integration of NS3 into OpenNebula
* Setup and Configuration of OpenNebula and NS-3

2.3.2 Phase I. Step B: Technical Layer, working Scenario

* Design of scenario
* Build a working scenario with all required elements (server, services)

2.3.3 Phase I, Step C: Operational Layer, Integration Event Injection System

* Integration of Event Injection System.
* Build tools and processes for operational level
