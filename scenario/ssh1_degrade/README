0. Prepare three vms: server, victim and attacker (they are available but it is not yet clear how we distribute these and others). NOTE: suggestions on what to consider when creating vms for a scenario follows later
1. execute ./setup.sh | multinode: ctrl -> ./setup_ctrl.sh, node -> setup_node.sh
2. attach server & attacker vm to ssh1-sw0 & victim to ssh1-sw1 (to its corresponding virtual network)
3. configure on either ssh1-sw0 or ssh1-sw1 (or both) an ip address in the same range (to trigger an inject)
4. execute ./start.sh in order to interconnect the switches via the network simulator ns3
5. inject via attacker vm
6. log in from victim to server and observe the attacker
7. examine dumps
