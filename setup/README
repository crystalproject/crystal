1. use bootstrap script to create your configuration (one per host)
current options:
- TYPE: ctrl or node (ctrl: install full opennebula, node: opennebula client)
- PREFIX: cidr of the current ip address of the host
- USER: user to login with (ssh)
- MPGREPREFIX: multipoint gre cidr address used for node intercommunication

2. execute build to build ns-3

3. execute deploy HOST (execute the ctrl host first)

4. (optional) execute install oplayer HOST to install the operational layer services. Note that you should use the hdb backend for the slapd service


General notes:
- This is currently under development and has to be considered highly experimental
- It is currently not so practical since you have to enter several passwords in order to put everything in place
- It currently lacks of several consistency checks
- It needs further testing
