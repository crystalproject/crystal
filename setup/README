for the ctr project two machines are required:
ctrl: it is a linux machine running opennebula, operational layer and deploying scenarios
node: linux server host which effectively runs virtual machine with qemu images

please note: this setup requires an linux distribution based on ubuntu 14.04!!!

for setting up the framework the following scripts need to be executed:

1. script: bootstrap
   * needs to be run on your client machine
   * with this script the user sets up the configuration files in the directory 'config' (will be created by the script) for the ctrl and the node.
   * the script needs to be run with the following parameter:
     - TYPE: ctrl or node 
     - PREFIX: cidr of the current ip address of the host
     - USER: user to login with (ssh)
     - MPGREPREFIX: multipoint gre cidr address used for node intercommunication
   * the parameters will be dumped in text files in the directory config
   * example parameters for ctrl and host can be found in the directory 'config.examples'
   

2. script: build
   * needs to be run on your client machine
   * this scripts loads the required packages for building ns-3 . the printed list can be dumped in a text file, which then can be used for installing the packages via:
     a. sudo apt-get update
     b. sudo apt-get -y install < $(cat dependencies.list)
   * ns-3 is also available in the ubuntu repository, but it has not been tested yet and some required modules are not available.
   * in order to build ns-3 the script 'build' needs to be executed a second time.

3. script: deploy
   * needs to be run on your client machine
   * copies all libraries, which are needed for ns-3, to {ctrl|node}
   * installs required packages for further functionalities of the framework

4. script: printspec
   * needs to be run on ctrl with the account 'oneadmin' or 'root'
   * prints out the following information:
     - http connection together with the ip address of the node via 'hostname -i'
     - all available connection with the ip addresses from 'ip addr show'
     - the corresponding password of the account 'oneadmin' stored in 'var/lib/one/.one/one_auth'
